🎯 Project Purpose
The PoUI (Proof of Utility Index) project exists to measure, score, and rank real utility in a transparent and reproducible way.
Its primary purpose is to move beyond hype, speculation, or popularity metrics by providing a data-driven framework that evaluates how useful, active, and adopted a project, asset, or system truly is.
This repository contains the PoUI MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — a functional implementation of the core logic behind utility-based scoring.
📌 Project Summary
The PoUI MVP is a Python-based prototype that:
Ingests raw utility metrics
Normalizes data for fair comparison
Applies weighted scoring rules
Produces a final PoUI score and ranking
It is designed as a foundational layer that can later power analytics platforms, governance models, ranking systems, or blockchain-based protocols.
